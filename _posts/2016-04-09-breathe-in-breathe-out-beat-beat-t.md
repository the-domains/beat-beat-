description: "Not long after moving to Melbourne, FL I discovered Paradise Beach and on it, a house that I've pictured a hundred times before in the books I read about mermaids, summer love, and treasure hunters. I claimed the \"back yard\" as my place to avoid the crowd lingering near the beach entrance, to lay out, go swimming, beach-comb, and yes, to watch the \"blood moon\" that had occurred later in the year of 2015. I'm sure in some other strand of time, I call this house my home. "

Not long after moving to Melbourne, FL I discovered Paradise Beach and on it, a house that I've pictured a hundred times before in the books I read about mermaids, summer love, and treasure hunters. I claimed the "back yard" as my place to avoid the crowd lingering near the beach entrance, to lay out, go swimming, beach-comb, and yes, to watch the "blood moon" that had occurred later in the year of 2015\. I'm sure in some other strand of time, I call this house my home.
